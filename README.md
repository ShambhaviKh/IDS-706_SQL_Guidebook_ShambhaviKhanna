## Overview

This project is a **personal SQL reference guide** created to demonstrate and document advanced SQL concepts using a restaurant orders dataset.  
It covers table creation, data insertion, data cleaning, joins, aggregation, window functions, CTEs, and other advanced SQL operations.  
The guide is intended as a reusable resource for **interview preparation** and **data analytics practice**.

---

## Why This Project

- To practice **SQL fundamentals** (DDL, DML, joins, aggregate functions).  
- To learn and document **advanced SQL features**: window functions, CTEs, data cleaning, string & date functions.  
- To create a **portfolio-ready SQL reference** for personal and professional use.  
- To analyze sample business data (restaurant orders) and answer realistic business questions.

## SQLite Version Check

To ensure compatibility, check your SQLite version in terminal:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

## Dataset used

Description:
This synthetic dataset contains 500 restaurant order records for beginners to practice data analysis and visualization. Generated using Python’s faker library, it contains no real customer information.

Columns:
Order ID, Customer Name, Food Item, Category, Quantity, Price, Payment Method, Order Time.

Use Cases:
EDA, data cleaning, visualization, and SQL practice. Explore trends like top-selling items, busiest order times, and preferred payment methods.

Modified the database according to our guidebook

## 📝 SQL Operations and Questions Covered

| SQL Operation / Feature | Example Query | Question / Purpose Answered |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| CREATE TABLE | `CREATE TABLE Customers ...` | Create database schema for customers, menu items, and orders |
| INSERT INTO | `INSERT INTO Orders ...` | Populate tables with sample data |
| UPDATE | `UPDATE Orders SET unit_price = 2.20 WHERE order_id = 1272;` | Update an order price |
| SELECT | `SELECT * FROM Orders;` | Retrieve all orders |
| WHERE | `SELECT order_id, unit_price FROM Orders WHERE order_id = 1272;` | Filter specific rows |
| ORDER BY | `ORDER BY total_spent DESC;` | Sort total spending per customer |
| GROUP BY | `GROUP BY c.customer_name` | Aggregate total spent per customer |
| HAVING | `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1` | Filter groups with minimum orders |
| LIMIT | `LIMIT 1` | Find the most popular menu item |
| JOIN (INNER JOIN) | `JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id` | Combine orders with customer info |
| JOIN (LEFT JOIN) | `LEFT JOIN Orders o ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id` | Include customers with no orders |
| Aggregate Functions | `SUM(o.quantity*o.unit_price), COUNT(*), AVG(quantity), MAX(quantity*unit_price)` | Revenue, total orders, avg quantity, max order |
| CASE WHEN | `CASE WHEN o.quantity >= 5 THEN 'Bulk Order' ... END` | Classify orders as Small, Medium, Bulk |
| CTE (WITH) | `WITH customer_spend AS (...) SELECT ...` | Compute total spend and rank customers |
| Window Functions | `RANK() OVER(...), ROW_NUMBER() OVER(...), LAG(...)` | Rank customers and get previous order totals |
| String Functions | `REPLACE(LOWER(payment_method), '_', ' ')` | Normalize payment method text |
| Date Functions | `substr(order_time,1,7)` | Extract order month from timestamp |
| COALESCE | `COALESCE(c.customer_name,'UNKNOWN')` | Handle missing customer names |
| UNION | `SELECT 'High' ... UNION SELECT 'Low' ...` | Categorize customers as High/Low spenders |

### Questions Answered Through Queries

| # | Question Answered |
|---|------------------|
| 1 | How can I update a specific order’s price? |

## How to Run

1. Save all SQL statements to a file named `restaurant_project.sql`.  
2. Open SQLite by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sqlite3 restro.db
```
3. Execute the SQL script inside SQLite:
```sql
.read restaurant_project.sql
```
